- Open source Parallel Scara Control Panel which use CAN-OPEN to communicate with the hardware

- The basic communication-Fcn code is written by Hubert Denkmair <hubert@denkmair.de>

- And this project is a specific software created by Qi qi.shield95@foxmail.com to be used for Parallel Scara Control.  This project is designed to Analysis, Control the Parallel-Scara-Robot(Kinematics, Dynamics), develop more complex function.

  

  the FOC driver(hardware) use the stm32f405rgt6 as it's mcu, the software run in the FOC driver can be find at here:

  and the single motor FOC control GUI Panel can be find here:
